This is all the definitions and stuff so you can ignore This as most of this is ai stuff. This is to keep track of concepts I'm learning. Most probably going to delete this once the project is done...

1. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that holds a specific version of Python and all the libraries and packages needed for a particular project. ðŸ“¦ It isolates the project's dependencies from other projects and the system-wide Python installation. This prevents conflicts and ensures that each project has its own unique set of tools, making it highly reproducible and portable.

2. streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source framework used to create beautiful, custom web applications for machine learning and data science projects quickly and easily. It allows developers to turn data scripts into shareable web apps in just a few lines of code, without needing to know front-end web development.

langchain

LangChain is a framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a structured way to chain together different componentsâ€”like language models, data sources, and other toolsâ€”to build more complex applications, such as chatbots or summarization tools.

openai

The openai library is the official Python client for the OpenAI API. It allows you to programmatically access powerful language models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and others. This is the library you use to send prompts and receive responses from OpenAI's models.

faiss-cpu

faiss-cpu is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. Developed by Facebook AI Research, it's particularly useful for applications that need to find the most similar items in a large database, like in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems where you need to quickly find relevant documents to a query. The -cpu suffix indicates it's the version optimized for CPU-only operations.

PyMuPDF

PyMuPDF is a high-performance Python library for working with PDF documents. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including rendering, extracting text and images, and converting documents. In the context of this application, it's likely being used to load and parse content from PDF files.

python-dotenv

python-dotenv is a library that reads key-value pairs from a .env file and sets them as environment variables. This is a best practice for securely managing sensitive information like API keys, as it prevents you from hardcoding secrets directly into your source code.
